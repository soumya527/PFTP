      Odisha (English: /əˈdɪsə/,[14] Odia: [oɽiˈsa] (listen)), formerly Orissa
      (/ɒˈrɪsə, ɔː-, oʊ-/[15] the official name until 2011), is an Indian state
      located in Eastern India. It is the 8th largest state by area, and the
      11th largest by population. The state has the third largest population of
      Scheduled Tribes in India.[16] It neighbours the states of Jharkhand and
      West Bengal to the north, Chhattisgarh to the west, and Andhra Pradesh to
      the south. Odisha has a coastline of 485 kilometres (301 mi) along the Bay
      of Bengal in Indian Ocean.[17] The region is also known as Utkala and is
      mentioned by this name in India's national anthem, "Jana Gana Mana".[18]
      The language of Odisha is Odia, which is one of the Classical Languages of
      India.[19] The ancient kingdom of Kalinga, which was invaded by the
      Mauryan Emperor Ashoka (which was again won back from them by King
      Kharavela) in 261 BCE resulting in the Kalinga War, coincides with the
      borders of modern-day Odisha.[20] The modern boundaries of Odisha were
      demarcated by the Indian government when Orissa Province was established
      on 1 April 1936, consisting of the Odia-speaking districts of Bihar and
      Orissa Province.[20] The first of April is celebrated as Utkala
      Dibasa/Odisha Day.[21] Cuttack was made the capital of the region by
      Anantavarman Chodaganga in c. 1135,[22] after which the city was used as
      the capital by many rulers, through the British era until 1948.
      Thereafter, Bhubaneswar became the capital of Odisha.[23] The economy of
      Odisha is the 16th-largest state economy in India with ₹5.86 trillion
      (US$73 billion) in gross domestic product and a per capita GDP of ₹127,383
      (US$1,600).[5] Odisha ranks 32nd among Indian states in Human Development
      Index.[24]
