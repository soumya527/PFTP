          >During an event in New York, Federer spoke in length about his
          friendship with Nadal. This is where he disclosed the fact his
          relationship with the Spaniard wasn’t always as smooth. Federer
          said,“I think as we got older, we knew that time was passing and we
          were soon not going to see each other as much. I started a family… it
          completely changes someone anyway.”</i

          >He continued, “And we started talking about totally different things
          in life…more injuries and kids…he’s also a father now. So the
          conversations changed. We also started to respect the rivalry we had
          and almost miss, playing against each other every other weekend. Back
          then we couldn’t stand each other, probably for that reason, but he’s
          a great man and I hope he can come back one more time.”</i
